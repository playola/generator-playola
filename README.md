# generator-playola
> Yeoman generator for React-Webpack projects - Lets you quickly set up a basic project using React and Webpack.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-playola using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-playola
```

Create a folder to allocate your project, and then generate it:

```
mkdir my-awesome-project && cd my-awesome-project
yo playola
```

One prompt will be triggered asking for the project name (by default "generator-playola"), and the rest will be added automatically.

Core packages:

  - react
  - webpack
  - babel
  - prop-types
