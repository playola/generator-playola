> This is project was bootstrapped using generator-playola

## Getting started
The dependencies should be installed with `generator-playola`, if the installation failed, install it manually with `npm install`. The `.gitignore` file is not generated, so you will need to add it manually for each project.

Once the dependencies are installed, start the application:
```
npm run dev
```
